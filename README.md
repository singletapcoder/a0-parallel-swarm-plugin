[![Release Plugin Bundle](https://github.com/up2itnow0822/a0-parallel-swarm-plugin/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/up2itnow0822/a0-parallel-swarm-plugin/actions/workflows/release.yml)

Run multiple Agent Zero agents at the same time. Fan out tasks, collect results, share findings between agents mid-execution.

We built this because we needed our A0 agents to research 5 markets simultaneously instead of crawling through them one by one. Turns out it's useful for a lot more than that.

## What it does

You give your agent a list of tasks. The plugin spins up parallel subordinate agents, runs them concurrently with bounded concurrency, manages token budgets so you don't blow your API bill, and collects all results back into one response.

**Key features:**

- **Parallel execution** — Up to 20 concurrent agents (default 5)
- **Task dependencies** — Build DAGs: "do A and B first, then C needs both results"
- **Token budgets** — Set total + per-task caps. No more surprise API bills.
- **Smart model routing** — Simple tasks get a cheap model, complex ones get the big guns
- **Shared memory** — Agents can pass findings to each other mid-execution via `swarm_share`
- **Adaptive throttling** — Backs off automatically when hitting rate limits

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/up2itnow0822/a0-parallel-swarm-plugin.git
cp -r a0-parallel-swarm-plugin /path/to/agent-zero/usr/plugins/parallel_swarm
```

### 2. Enable in Settings

Agent Zero → Settings → Agent tab → Parallel Swarm → toggle on.

### 3. Use it

Your agent now has two new tools:

**`call_swarm`** — Dispatch parallel tasks:
```
Research these 3 topics simultaneously:
1. Current Bitcoin market sentiment
2. Ethereum DeFi TVL trends
3. Solana NFT marketplace activity
```

The agent will automatically use `call_swarm` to fan out the work.

**`swarm_share`** — Agents share findings with each other during execution:
```json
{
  "key": "btc_sentiment",
  "value": "Strongly bullish — 3 whale wallets accumulated 2000 BTC in 24h",
  "tags": "crypto,sentiment"
}
```

## How it works

```
You: "Research X, Y, Z simultaneously"
    │
    ▼
┌──────────────┐
│  call_swarm  │  ← Your agent dispatches tasks
└──────┬───────┘
       │
   ┌───┼───┐
   │   │   │
   ▼   ▼   ▼
  A1  A2  A3     ← Parallel subordinate agents
   │   │   │
   └───┼───┘
       │
       ▼         ← Results collected, formatted, returned
  Combined Response + Token Usage Report
```

### Task Dependencies (DAG)

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"id": "research", "message": "Find the top 5 competitors"},
    {"id": "pricing", "message": "Get their pricing pages"},
    {"id": "analysis", "message": "Compare and recommend", "depends_on": ["research", "pricing"]}
  ]
}
```

Level 0: `research` + `pricing` run in parallel
Level 1: `analysis` runs after both complete, with their results available

### Model Routing

When auto-classify is on, the plugin sorts tasks by complexity:

| Complexity | Routed to | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Simple | Cheap/fast model | "Count items in this list" |
| Moderate | Default model | "Summarize this document" |
| Complex | Heavy model | "Design a system architecture" |

Configure model overrides in the settings UI to use specific models per tier.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `max_concurrency` | 5 | Max parallel agents |
| `token_budget` | 100,000 | Total token cap for all tasks |
| `per_task_budget` | 20,000 | Per-task token cap |
| `auto_classify` | true | Route tasks to models by complexity |
| `shared_memory` | true | Enable `swarm_share` between agents |
| `simple_model` | (default) | Model override for simple tasks |
| `complex_model` | (default) | Model override for complex tasks |
| `backpressure_threshold` | 0.8 | Throttle when this % of slots active |

## Architecture

The plugin adds 5 modules to your A0 installation:

- `SwarmOrchestrator` — Coordinates parallel dispatch with dependency resolution
- `TokenPool` — Centralized budget management, pre-allocation prevents overruns
- `ConcurrencyManager` — Semaphore-based parallelism with adaptive backpressure
- `SwarmMemory` — Ephemeral shared key-value store for cross-agent communication
- `ModelRouter` — Classifies task complexity and routes to appropriate models

All modules are async-native and thread-safe.

## Example: Research 5 Markets Simultaneously

Here's a concrete example dispatching 5 parallel market research tasks with a dependency chain — the final synthesis task waits for all research to complete:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "crypto",
      "description": "Analyze cryptocurrency market",
      "message": "Research current BTC and ETH price action, volume trends, and whale activity. Provide a 2-paragraph summary with key data points.",
      "complexity": "moderate",
      "priority": 0
    },
    {
      "id": "equities",
      "description": "Analyze US equities market",
      "message": "Research S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow performance over the past week. Note any sector rotation or unusual volume.",
      "complexity": "moderate",
      "priority": 0
    },
    {
      "id": "forex",
      "description": "Analyze forex market",
      "message": "Research USD strength index, EUR/USD, and GBP/USD trends. Note central bank policy impacts.",
      "complexity": "simple",
      "priority": 0
    },
    {
      "id": "commodities",
      "description": "Analyze commodities market",
      "message": "Research gold, oil, and natural gas price movements. Note supply/demand factors driving changes.",
      "complexity": "simple",
      "priority": 0
    },
    {
      "id": "defi",
      "description": "Analyze DeFi ecosystem",
      "message": "Research total DeFi TVL, top protocol inflows/outflows, and emerging yield opportunities.",
      "complexity": "moderate",
      "priority": 0
    },
    {
      "id": "synthesis",
      "description": "Cross-market synthesis and recommendations",
      "message": "Using findings from all 5 market analyses, identify cross-market correlations, risk factors, and provide 3 actionable trading recommendations with confidence levels.",
      "complexity": "complex",
      "priority": 1,
      "depends_on": ["crypto", "equities", "forex", "commodities", "defi"]
    }
  ],
  "max_concurrency": 5,
  "token_budget": 150000
}
```

**Execution flow:**

```
Level 0 (parallel): crypto + equities + forex + commodities + defi
                     ↓           ↓         ↓          ↓          ↓
                     └───────────┴─────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
                                           ↓
Level 1 (sequential):              synthesis (uses all results)
```

**Expected output format:**

```
## Task: Analyze cryptocurrency market
**Status:** completed

BTC trading at $61,200 with 24h volume up 15%...

---

## Task: Analyze US equities market
**Status:** completed

S&P 500 closed at 5,180, up 0.8% on the week...

---

... (3 more market tasks) ...

---

## Task: Cross-market synthesis and recommendations
**Status:** completed

**Cross-Market Correlations:**
1. Risk-on sentiment across crypto and equities...

**Recommendations:**
1. Long BTC/USD (confidence: 72%) — whale accumulation + positive equity correlation
2. Short EUR/USD (confidence: 65%) — ECB dovish signals vs Fed hold
3. Long Gold (confidence: 58%) — geopolitical hedge with declining real yields

---
**Swarm Summary:** 6/6 tasks completed | Total tokens consumed: 47,832
```


## OpenRouter Worker Mode

This fork adds an **OpenRouter-backed worker mode** for cost-controlled, auditable
parallel coding/review tasks. It is designed for workflows where the swarm should
produce candidate artifacts only, while a human/Jarvis gatekeeper reviews and
applies changes separately.

### OpenRouter task fields

A `call_swarm` task can now include OpenRouter-specific fields:

```json
{
  "id": "M5_003",
  "description": "Fixture-only accounting edge candidate",
  "message": "Produce a candidate patch only.",
  "backend": "openrouter",
  "model": "deepseek/deepseek-chat",
  "role": "cheap_coder",
  "fallback_policy": "stop_not_direct_code",
  "output_dir": "/absolute/path/to/artifacts/M5_003",
  "allowed_files": ["tests/test_position_accounting.py"],
  "forbidden_actions": ["broker_calls", "credential_resolution", "live_trading"],
  "expected_artifacts": ["metadata.json", "prompt.md", "raw_response.md", "candidate_patch.diff"],
  "context_repo_path": "/absolute/path/to/TradingV4",
  "include_allowed_file_context": true,
  "strict_diff": true,
  "validate_git_apply": true
}
```

`backend: "openrouter"` routes the task through the OpenRouter worker helper instead
of the normal Agent Zero subordinate monologue path. The fallback policy
`stop_not_direct_code` is intentionally fail-closed: if OpenRouter is unavailable,
the task blocks rather than silently falling back to the primary model.

### Role/model registry

Tasks may specify an exact `model`, or use a known `role` that resolves to a
pinned model:

| Role | Default model |
|---|---|
| `cheap_coder` | `deepseek/deepseek-chat` |
| `long_context_worker` | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` |
| `coding_lead` | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` |
| `review_gate` | `google/gemini-2.5-pro` |
| `architect_arbiter` | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.1` |

Explicit per-task `model` values always win over role resolution. Unknown roles
without an explicit model remain unresolved so OpenRouter tasks can fail closed
instead of guessing.

### Artifact contract

Each OpenRouter task writes durable artifacts under `output_dir`:

- `prompt.md` — exact prompt sent to the worker
- `raw_response.md` — full model response
- `candidate_patch.diff` — first fenced diff/patch block, if present
- `metadata.json` — backend/model/fallback/status/token/patch-validation metadata

Patch validation metadata includes empty-patch detection, basic unified-diff shape
checks, touched-file extraction, and allowed-file violation detection.

For higher-quality patch candidates, tasks can opt into a stricter mode:

- `context_repo_path` points at a local checkout used only for reading allowed-file
  context and optional non-mutating validation.
- `include_allowed_file_context: true` embeds the current contents of each
  `allowed_files` entry into the worker prompt. Paths are resolved safely under
  `context_repo_path`; path escapes are blocked.
- `strict_diff: true` requires the worker to return a raw unified diff, `NO_PATCH`,
  or `BLOCKED_FOR_SAFETY_BOUNDARY` with no markdown wrapper or extra prose.
- `validate_git_apply: true` runs `git apply --check` against `context_repo_path`
  and records the result in `metadata.json`. It does not apply the patch or mutate
  the checkout.

Even with strict mode, tests and human/Jarvis review remain required before any
candidate is applied.

### One-shot launcher tool

The plugin also provides `run_openrouter_worker`, a one-worker tool wrapper around
the deterministic launcher. It requires a single JSON task object and an absolute
`output_dir` so artifacts are durable from the start.

Use this for pilot tasks or controlled single-worker execution. Use `call_swarm`
for multi-task fan-out after the one-shot path is proven.

### Safety model

OpenRouter workers should generate **candidate patches/reports only**. They should
not directly apply changes, run live systems, access secrets, deploy, publish,
clear halts, or claim release/live/deployment readiness. The intended workflow is:

```text
OpenRouter worker -> candidate artifacts -> Jarvis/human review -> git apply/check/tests -> PR/merge
```

## Requirements
